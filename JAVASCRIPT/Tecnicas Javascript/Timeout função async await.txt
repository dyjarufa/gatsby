ion wait(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(resolve, ms);
  });
}
And an simple example of its use, perhaps looping over some API calls but delaying a second between each (rate limiting):


async function doRequests(uris) {
  for(const uri of uris) {
    await fetch(uri);
    await wait(1000);
  }
}
